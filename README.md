OSC + ofxFaceTracker 
==================
Recently I read how drawn lines can express emotion, for example more curved lines express calm mood and more harsh, straight lines could express excitement . This application takes the users face expression values via Kyle McDonalds' FaceOSC and transform them into animated lines. For example, your mouth control how curved the lines should be, your eyes the speed they move, your eyebrows the distance between them.
